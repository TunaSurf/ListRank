# ListRank

Often times, my friends like to create lists of potential restaurants/bars to visit and rank them from least to most exciting to determine where we will spend our evening. ListRank is a tool I created to simplify this process. Built with React and kept as simple as possible to promote ease-of-use during nights out.

## How to Use

Begin by setting the number of friends and options you will be ranking. Based on the number of options selected, fill in the corresponding spaces with the values of what your group will be ranking. When your options are set, press start and begin ranking. Friend 1 begins by ranking all of the options from least to most enticing, each with a unique ranking. Continue until each friend has voted. At the end of the group's vote, ListRank will add up each of the option's cumulative rank, and show the group their new list sorted from most to least voted!
